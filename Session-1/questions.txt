1. Q: What is IaC?
   A: Infrastructure as code is the process of managing
      and provisioning computer data centers through 
      machine-readable definition files, rather than 
      physical hardware configuration or interactive 
      configuration tools.
      Infrastructure as code (IaC) means to manage your
      IT infrastructure using configuration files.
2. Q: What is the difference between immutable
      and mutable  infrastructure?
   A: Mutable infrastructure can be updated, configured
      as per the requirement. It is possible to login to
      servers, apply patches, update configuration, scale
      up/down it etc. Immutable infrastructure is something 
      which can never be modified once it is deployed.
3. Q: What is the difference between imperative
      and declarative approach?
   A: Declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a 
      style of building the structure and elements of 
      computer programs—that expresses the logic of a
      computation without describing its control flow. 
      This is in contrast with imperative programming,
      which implements algorithms in explicit steps.
4. Q: What is idempotence? 
   A: Idempotence, in programming and mathematics, is a
      property of some operations such that no matter 
      how many times you execute them, you achieve the
      same result.
